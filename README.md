# ðŸ”± MoodMate - Mood & Habit Tracker

Hi there!  
 Welcome to MoodMate, a beginner-friendly project I created using Python and now also as a simple website.

## What It Does
- Welcomes you warmly
- Asks for your name and how you're feeling (your mood)
- Checks if you:
  - Your current mood
   - Slept quality
  - Morning habits(breakfast, water)
  - Exercise
  -  Weekly goal
  - Age group & preferred time
- Gives you a short, uplifting message based on your answers and also gives motivational quotes to inspire you.
- (Python) Saves in a log file if you want to keep a record
- (Web) Shows your summary instantly in your browser
- Saves mood history so you can see your progress over time

## What I Used

- Python 3.13 for the original script
- HTML,CSS,JavaScript for the website version
- VS Code to write and run code

## Why I Built This

I'm learning Python and web development and wanted to build something personal and emotional supportive.  
MoodMate became my space to:
- Practise clean and friendly code
- Collect user input meaningfully
- learn decision making using if/else logic
- Build a self-care habit tracker that feels connected to human mood
- Save info into a file (Python)
- Run and debug projects in VS Code

## What's Next?

- I'm planning to add more features, like voice-enabled mood logging, mood calendar and jornaling writing page.
- I'm planning to make website usuable for users to access the mood tracker on their phones
